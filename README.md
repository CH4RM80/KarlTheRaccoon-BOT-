# KarlTheRaccoon-BOT-
Just a bot made around the theme of Karl from Bungou Stray Dogs(This is the first bot I have really attempted to make)
This is just a project that I started that I thought would help me learn a little more about JS in general, its very simple to run, its just the main file and config.json
All you have to do is grab your token to your bot, get discord.js:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For those who have npm already:

# npm install discord.js
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# To install npm on windows and mac: https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To install npm and node.js on Linux:

# sudo apt-get install node.js
# sudo apt-get install npm
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Then make a file called ".env", and paste the following inside it:
```
prefix=(paste your token here)
```
-------------
node index.js
